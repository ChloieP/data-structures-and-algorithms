# Array Binary Search
Binary search in a sorted 1-dimensional array

## Challenge
Write a function that takes in two parameters, a sorted array and a value. Return the index of the array element that equals the value or returns -1 if the value does not exist as an array element. Write tests for this code and submit when they all pass.

## Approach & Efficiency
I started with reading the challenge carefully, and then went to the whiteboard to think through the problem fully. I used a wiki article on binary search that became the source of ideation for my pseudocode and algorithm. This challenge took 3 hours.
