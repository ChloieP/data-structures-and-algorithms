# Find Edges
Given a business trip itinerary, and an Alaska Airlines route map, is the trip possible with direct flights? If so, how much will the total trip cost be?

## Challenge

Write a function based on the specifications above, which takes in a graph, and an array of city names. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return whether the full trip is possible with direct flights, and how much it would cost.

## Approach & Efficiency
* I critically read the challenge and then referred to lecture notes from a few days ago. I did a bit of research online and then began ideation. I wrote up my idea on the whiteboard.

* I believe the time and space complexity for graph is O(N+E).
