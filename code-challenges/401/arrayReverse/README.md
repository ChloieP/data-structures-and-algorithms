# Reverse an Array
Reverse an array using none of the built-in methods of JavaScript.

## Challenge
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency
I read the problem domain thoroughly until I understood it. Then I worked the problem out on a whiteboard. Thinking I had the solution, wrote my code into the editor only to find I did not have the right solution. After some research and refactoring, I found the solution. This challenge took 3.5 hours.
