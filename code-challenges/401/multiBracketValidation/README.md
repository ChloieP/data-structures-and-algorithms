# Code Challenge Class 13

## Challenge Summary
Multi-bracket Validation

## Challenge Description
On your main file, create:

* The JS function ```multiBracketValidation(input)```

Your function should take a string as its only argument, and should return a boolean representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced. There are 3 types of brackets:

* Round Brackets : ```()```
* Square Brackets : ```[]```
* Curly Brackets : ```{}```

## Approach & Efficiency
I created a function called multiBracketValidation(input) and return eda boolean representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced. I also used TDD.
