# Hashtable
Implement a Hashtable using the methods stated below.

## Challenge
1. ```add```: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.

2. ```get```: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.

3. ```contains```: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.

4. ```hash```: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.



## Approach & Efficiency
I took a pair-programming/collaborative approach to this lab for expediency as this lab was a Saturday lab required to makeup required Apprenti hours lost to the July 4th holiday. The worst case scenario for hashtable is O(n).
