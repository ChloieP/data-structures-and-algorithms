# Code Challenge Class 12

## Challenge Summary
First-in, First out Animal Shelter.

## Challenge Description
Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach. Ensure that you create your class with the following methods:

* ```enqueue(animal)``` which inserts ```animal``` into the shelter, using a first-in, first-out approach and can be a cat or dog object.

* ```dequeue(pref)``` returns a cat or dog. If ```pref``` is not ```"dog"``` or ```"cat"``` return null.

## Approach & Efficiency
I created a new class for AnimalShelter and two methods: enqueue(animal) and dequeue(pref).
