# Depth First Search
Conduct a depth first traversal of a graph

## Challenge

Create a function that accepts an adjacency list as a graph, and conducts a depth first traversal. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order.

## Approach & Efficiency
* I critically read the challenge and then referred to lecture notes from a few days ago. I did a bit of research online and then began ideation. I wrote up my idea on the whiteboard.

* I believe the time and space complexity for graph is O(n).
