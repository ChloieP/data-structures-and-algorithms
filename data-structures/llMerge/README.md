# Lab-08 Linked List Zip Merge
Zip Merge 2 Singly-Linked Lists (assumed sorted)

## Challenge
* Write a function called 'mergeLists' which takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list. Try and keep additional space down to O(1). You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.
* CONTINUATION via Code Challenge 6:

* .append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
* .insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
* .insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node

## Approach & Efficiency
I started with reading the challenge carefully, and then went to the whiteboard to think through the problem fully. I used a wiki article on binary search that became the source of ideation for my pseudocode and algorithm. This challenge took 3 hours.

I started with reading the challenge carefully, and then wrote down my plan on the whiteboard. This challenge took 4 hours and the tests are giving me fits.
